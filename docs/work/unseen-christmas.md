        For the 2016 Christmas Campaign, [Aesop Agency](http://aesopagency.com) worked with a number of the UK’s top illustrators to devise a unique campaign that uses paper chain strips to illustrate stories of four individuals – all victims of modern slavery in the UK.

        The site allowed anyone to purchase a set of paper chains featuring the illustrations, using a pay-what-you-want mechanic. This involved integration with Stripe for the payment system.
